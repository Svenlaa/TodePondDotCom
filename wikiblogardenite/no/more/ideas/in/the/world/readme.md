# No more ideas in the world 

[No more ideas] will always be relevant in a world that values stuff stuff stuff— in a world that values getting brand new shiny stuff all the time because "new stuff is good" and "we love new stuff"

We're surrounded by drivel, utter drivel, complete and utter drivel. Adverts that make us feel bad or feel wanting because we haven't got the new shiny thing GET THE NEW SHINY THING YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT GET IT

Christmas is the worst. We're conditioned to get each other so much stuff stuff stuff— new stuff that we don't want, when what we really need is less, less stuff and more space, more room to breathe

Don't get me wrong I love getting presents and unwrapping them and that's the whole— I'm trapped in this as much as you are

## No more ideas

[No more ideas] combats the thousands of tech dudes lining up to make the brand new shiny thing that'll *change the world!*

Alan Kay Bret Victor fanboys lining up to be the next Alan Kay Bret Victor and *change the world!* secretly hoping that they become the hero and determine the course of the computing future with all their *new stuff!* their *new shiny stuff!*

At the end of the day that's what the future of coding and Human Computer Interaction (ugh) communities have become just insular islands that make new stuff and new ideas

we've built an ideas factory, we pump out ideas and prototypes whether they're products or not, we pump them out, and where do they go? 

where do all those brand new ideas go? 

absolutely fuckin nowhere
