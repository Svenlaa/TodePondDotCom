# The wikiblogarden turns one year old

I started [My wikiblogarden](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden) over a year ago.

You're reading it right now.

## Hackernews is a vile website

A few of my early posts went viral, mostly from reaching the front page of hackernews. This includes:

- [Are analytics good?](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/analytics/)
- [AI is good/bad actually](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/artificial-intelligence/bad/good/)
- [Minification is evil](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/minification/)

So yeah, it turns out that "X is bad/good" is a winning formula.

[Minification is evil](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38379731) is my favourite because it's [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) a tiny poem.

But please remember, [Hackernews is a vile website](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/hackernews).

## Just 
 [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) continues to be my most viewed post, flaring up on social media every few months or so.

Some people love it and some people really really hate it because they fail to [Just read the article](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/read/), which helps the virality, I think.

I've picked up the habit of linking to [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) any time I say [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) in one of my blog posts.

I can't unsee it now.

## Lu loo tales

As time went on, I began to write more and more personal stuff, not just computer stuff.

One of the early occurrences of this was the [Lu loo tales](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/loo-lu/end/) but the most personal (by far) was [My conversion therapy story](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/conversion-therapy/).

Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't share such personal information, or what would happen if my friends or colleagues read it and it changes what they think of me.

On the other hand, it's the blog post I receive the most emails about. Many people tell me they went through the same nasty things as me.

It's nice to know I'm not alone.

## I went to an algorave

I gradually became more and more comfortable with writing longer posts. The longest one is currently [I went to an algorave](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/) and I'm pleased I made it that length.

Sometimes you need a long time to tell a story.

## Cardboard cutouts

Another of the long ones is [Cardboard cutouts](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/cardboard/cutouts/), which remains as one of the only posts I have ever written about my teaching career.

I still find it hard to write about my teaching days because it makes me quite emotional, but I hope to do it more in the future. 

The difficulty pushed me to adopt a 'fractured' writing style which makes use of lots of interspersed little snippets of story. I have grown to love this approach and I now use it often.

Here are some posts that make use of cutout style: 

- [Cardboard cutouts](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/cardboard/cutouts/)
- [Vomit diaries](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/vomit/diaries/introduction/)
- [I went to an algorave](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/)
- Opening at heart of clojure (still writing this one) 

## Just practice

It's practice, [Just practice](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/platform/), when I write on [My wikiblogarden](/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden). And supposedly, I am getting better at writing. But sometimes I get frustrated and all I can think of is that [Words are hard](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/voice/finding/words) and [Words](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/words) words words are out to get me and writing is [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) one of those [Things I am bad at](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/me/bad/). But yes, I do believe I am getting better / a little bit better / little by little. 

<!-- I hope I can keep getting a little bit better than before: The same but slightly different -->

## Definitions that don't matter

For a very long time, I wanted to write up my [Define define](https://youtu.be/ZMklf0vUl18) video into a blog post / an essay. I tried and I tried, I wrote and I wrote and I rewrote my words into many— I tried many different shapes and forms and tones and lengths but I couldn't figure it out.

<br>

But after tons and tons of practice, I managed to bash it out in an hour with [Definitions that don't matter](https://www.todepond.com/report/definitions-that-dont-matter/) and it ended up quite short. You can be the judge of whether it was worth it or not

But yes, the more I write, the more I write more fluidly.

## Unblocking creation with friends

When it was time to sit down and write up my [Arroost](/explore/arroost) work, it went okay. I wrote an essay called [Unblocking creation with friends](/report/arroost) and I'm happy with it. 

I could never imagine writing a whole essay like that before, not even twelve months ago. I'm pleased (relieved) I can do it now.

## I'm here now

I'm also pleased to see other people spin up their own wikiblogarden projects.

I've seen quite a number of websites start with an opening post saying they were inspired by the wikiblogarden in some way, like Sven's [I'm here now](https://svenlaa-com.pages.dev/bloggo/im-here-now/) and Jayrude's [Hello friends](https://jayrude.dev/blog/hello-friends/) and Enderprism's [I made a blog because Todepond asked me to](https://enderprism.github.io/post/new-blog/).

I also get sad when they inevitably end.

## Things that happened in September

The wikiblogarden has now attracted some subtle criticism too! Which is surely another milestone.

Yes, Philippa Markovics winks at the wikiblogarden in [Things that happened in September](https://trimmings.wtf/sept-2024). In the introductory post, she states that her website is a website, and not a wiki or a blog or a memex or a garden or a blah or an anything like a wikiblogarden, and she reminds you of this in the footer on every single page:

> This website is not a memex nor a garden nor a blog nor a diary or dairy or a portfolio or a wiki. It’s a website.

And if you click on "website", you get a poem. She hints (in the poem) that "wikiblogarden" is a long and fancy word and you don't need to make it so stupidly complicated. It's a minor mockery / parody of the wikiblogarden and I welcome it.

<br>

Of course, her mockery of the word "wikiblogarden" embodies the exact obsession that the word "wikiblogarden" mocks, and so, as a response, I now— In this very moment, right now, as you read this, I will now permanently change the name of the wikiblogarden to something else.

*I, [Lu or Luke (either's fine) Wilson](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/), hereby rename the "wikiblogarden" to the "wikiblogardenite"!*

It is no longer a wiki or blog or garden. It is now a wiki or blog or garden or site, seeing as three clearly wasn't enough for some people.

# One year of the wikiblogardenite

The wikiblogardenite gave me a place for tiny little coded experiments. Yes, I started building small and slippy things for the [Tadi lab](/lab).

## Counter

[Counter](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/lab/counter/) went decently viral, which is surprising when you consider that it's just a button with a counter that increases when you press it.

I guess the interesting part is that it increases the number for everyone in the world, not just you. And It's remarkable how difficult it is to do this with modern tools, despite what some people might tell you.

## Login

By far, the biggest success to come out of the lab is [Login](/lab/login) and, by extension, the [Logiverse](https://logiverse.social).

It's a fully distributed / decentralised social media network, which sounds fancy but all it means is that multiple people are now running their own servers / instances / stores / appviews / websites / whatevers. Ah— That does sound complicated...

It's a social network that isn't just run by one company or person. Multiple people run their own parts of the network, and we all connect to each other's parts and together it makes a large network. It makes the network stronger because if one of us goes bad or disappears, the larger network can continue being good. It means that no single person or company has control over the whole thing. It's shared responsibility. 

There are already things out there that claim to do this, like mastodon and bluesky, but they're so difficult to do that it's more of a hypothetical. Especially bluesky.

But in the Logiverse it's easy. I've seen complete beginners do it. 

Yes, I'm really quite impressed by what people have done with Login. It was nothing to do with me, so I'm thankful for the community for doing all that work.

## Building community

One of the more 'highly rated' posts on the wikiblogardenite is [Building community], where I share my findings from a question I asked loads of researchers. 

More largely, it represents a moment of change for me in my own work, away from making **things**, and towards making **space**.

We are truly within the [No more ideas](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-ideas) era of the todepond universe. And also [No more tools](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/no-more-tools) and [No more products](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/work/no-more-products) and so on. 

We have enough!!!!!

## Never stop writing

One thing I know is... I will [Never stop writing](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/). And that's certainly not easy. Sometimes I ask myself [Why bother](https://todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/why-bother) but I've managed to keep going so far 

Those uncomfortable moments when writing / continuing writing feels uncomfortable are also the moments where I learn most. I try to keep pushing through those moments.

## Vomit diaries

It took a real push to write the [Vomit diaries](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/vomit/diaries/introduction). For a start, the act of writing it made me feel physically sick. But it also took a long time too.

Despite all that, I am pleased I did it! I shared something that I wanted to share, and I practised writing an episodic story. 

I started it because there is another episodic thing that I'm still trying to write, but I was finding it too hard, so I thought I would practise with something less important first / with the [Vomit diaries](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/vomit/diaries/introduction). And people seemed to like it. Thank god for that.

## Write your blog on your phone

The best way to keep myself writing is by writing my blog from my phone. I explained my thinking for this in [Write your blog on your phone](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/on-your-phone), which was turned into a [song](https://mathstodon.xyz/@ngons/112105422898363468) by ngons.

## Dashes

Through my incessant writing, I have picked up various habits / quirks. The most prominent being [Dashes](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/handwriting), which I explained in the long [I went to an algorave](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/) post. 

I've also started using slashes to represent branching pathways / options that I don't care about choosing between. It's like a dash but— With dashes, I'm making visible— I'm showing you a moment where I'm not sure whether to delete something or not. With slashes, I'm showing you when / where I can't decide what to add. If it makes no / little difference, then why not show both?

## Pasta gang

I run a heavy [Quality control](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/repetition/quality/control/) system. The vast majority of my posts get rejected, and thrown in the bin. 

However, I have recently started to share my binned posts, as long as they have the disclaimer that they are binned, such as [Pasta gang](https://www.todepond.com/sky/tode-pasta/binned-version/). You can read the beginning of the eventual unbinned version in [I learned a programming language by accident]. But it's funny. I actually prefer some things from the binned version in the end. 

Either way, you get to see both / to see my process.

## It's weird when people recognise me

Another binned post is [It's weird when people recognise me](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/para/meeting/).

Despite being binned, it is still true. 

People used to only—

No. This section is binned.

<br>

<hr>

<br>

At some point, I realised that headings / titles were a crutch to me.

All of my writing followed the same sort of structure and it became boring and repetitive. So with [No more titles](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-titles/), I decreed that I wouldn't use titles anymore, and I stuck to it / I went cold turkey for a long time. I didn't use any titles or subtitles on any post, even though this means you can't even click on those posts because there's no title to click.

<br>

<hr>

<br>

I only re-introduced titles after I grew free from them, with [Blog posts don't need titles](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-titles/crutches/titles) yes

the titles were back but my wikiblogardenite was forever changed 

and I now write in a looser way

# I break the rules more

!!!!!!

<br>

<hr>

<br>

My wikiblogardenite is a playground for writing I play around with different writing styles trying to hit the limits of what i can get away with and that keeps me learning

<br>

<hr>

<br>

I started putting my weekly [Pondcast](/pondcast) on my wikiblogardenite too. It feels good to be free from closed platforms. 

<br>

With [Todepond](https://www.todepond.com/pondcast/todepond/), I started changing the look and feel of the pondcast, to further differentiate it from the rest of the wikiblogardenite.

This lets me mess around in wikiblogardenite land without harming the visual language of the slightly more serious pondcast

<br>

<hr>

<br>

And here we are, in the present day. 

Turns out, (quite) a lot of people read the wikiblogardenite now, and that gives me a (small) platform. So of course, I feel obliged to try to use it for (a little bit of) good. 

Yes, I've been using it to share some of the struggles I experience as a trans person, in [Sulfasalazine](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/sulfasalazine/) and [Sulfasalazine: The sequel](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/sulfasalazine/two) and [The enshittification of GenderGP](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/visibility/) and [Today is a sad](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/sad-day) and [Clickbait title](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/sad-day/cass) and so on and really is quite boring / tiring. But I feel obliged to say *something*.

I also write about the challenges I face from other queer / trans people with things like [My internalised transphobia](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/internalised/transphobia/) and [Baby trans considered harmful](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/internalised/transphobia/baby-trans) and [Passing is bullshit](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/internalised/transphobia/passing/is-bullshit) and [Transition in slow motion](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/transition/in-slow-motion/) and ugghhhh

my theory is that some queer people sometimes think "I'm queer so I can't possibly be queerphobic" and this leads to queer people being some of the worst offenders.

There's a lot of biphobia and enbyphobia within queer circles and unfortunately I am both of those things so it's nice to have a place to rant about it!!!!!!!!

## I wrote a blog post about that

As I've said in the past, my only goal with this blog is to have written a blog post about absolutely everything, so that when anyone says anything to me, I can say "I wrote a blog post about that".

I even wrote a blog post about how [I wrote a blog post about that](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/posts/about/that) and it's fun being able do that double tag joke in person.

If you don't know what a "tag" is then feel free to write my post about jokes called [What is a joke](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/comedy/).

## Chaos to the canon

Sometimes people send me private messages, despite me asking everyone to [Please stop sending me messages](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/para/messages/). And sometimes they ask me to write a blog post about something, or to hurry up on one that's in progress.

This helped me discover a new business opportunity to add to my list of [How I get money](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/work/how-i-get-money) so I offered to fast track any blog post for the rip off price of 99 pounds

And to my utter surprisal, two people did it. Thank you to those two! One person specified no preference, so the second person got to choose, and they chose [Chaos to the canon](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/canon/chaos/no-escape/).

# One year of the wikiblogardenite

So where are they now?

## Death of the tadi web

I gave my first talk about the wikiblogardenite! Hopefully the first of many. It was *only indirectly* about the wikiblogardenite but it *definitely was* about the wikiblogardenite. It was called [Death of the tadi web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo) and it was a fun one to perform.

## Are analytics good

And yes, as foretold by [Are analytics good](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/analytics/), I did eventually add analytics. They're publicly available on my [Analytics](https://www.todepond.com/analytics/) page and also [Goatcounter](https://todepond.goatcounter.com).

I'm not ashamed.

## The sky

Thank you for being here this year.

I promise you that the wikiblogardenite will not end while I'm alive.

<br>

Back to the [wikiblogardenite](/wikiblogardenite).
